<p> PoleAdaptation (can be renamed better) module relates to the specific rate-adaptation part of WASL. 
It is separated from the Optimizing Controller module for <em>flexibility in invocation</em>. 
Conceptually, a specific application(s) and the System should be able to invoke the rate-adaptation method from this module 
from their respective adaptation modules.
